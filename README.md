## Task
This project explores harmful ingredients found in cosmetic products using a dataset extracted from the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) in the California Department of Public Health.

The primary purpose of the CSCP is to collect information on hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California and to make this information available to the public.


## Process

Kicking off the analysis, I downloaded the relevant dataset from Data.Gov. After the download, I cleaned and organized the data using SQL. To isolate specific patterns and trends, I created separate sheets, meticulously breaking down the information. Finally, each prepared sheet was loaded into Tableau for visualization.
